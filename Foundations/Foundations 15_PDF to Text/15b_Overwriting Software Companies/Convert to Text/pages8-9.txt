with the particular hard disk being sanitized. In addition, some software product versions
may not have the capability to remove the OS during the overwriting process. To ensure
the integrity of the sanitization process, overwriting software must have the following
functions and capabilities:

2.1.1. The ability to purge all data or information, including the OS, from
the physical or virtual drives, thereby making it impossible to recover any
meaningful data by keyboard or laboratory attack.

2.1.2. A compatibility with, or capability to run independent of, the OS
loaded on the hard drive.

2.1.3. A compatibility with, or capability to run independent of, the type of
hard drive being sanitized (e.g., ATA/IDE or SCSI type hard drives).

2.1.4. A capability to overwrite the entire hard disk drive independent of
any BIOS or ﬁrmware capacity limitation that the system may have.

2.1.5. A capability to overwrite using a minimum of three cycles (six
passes) of data patterns on all sectors, blocks, tracks, and slack or unused disk space
on the entire hard disk medium.

2.1.6. A method to verify that all data has been removed from the entire
hard drive and to View the overwrite pattern.

2.1.7. Although not mandatory, selected software should also:

2.7.1.1. Provide the user with a validation certiﬁcate indicating that
the overwriting procedure was completed properly.

2.7.1.2. Provide a defects log, or listing of any bad sectors, that
could not be overwritten by the software.

2.2. Software Available for Overwriting: Listed below are products and
manufacturers that produce overwriting software tools. These products are currently in
use by DoD Components and are considered to meet the minimum standards called out in
this policy. Note: This listing is not all-inclusive and there may be other products that
meet the required speciﬁcations in addition to the products listed below.

2.3. Damaged Hard Disks: A hard disk platter may develop damaged or unusable
tracks and sectors. However, sensitive data may have been recorded in areas of the disk
that should be purged. If features or malfunctions of the storage media inhibit
overwriting, the storage media should be degaussed or destroyed.

3. Degaussing Hard Drives for Sanitization: Degaussing is a process whereby the
magnetic media are erased, (i.e., returned to a zero state). Degaussing (demagnetizing)
reduces the magnetic ﬂux to Virtual zero by applying a reverse magnetizing ﬁeld.
Properly applied, degaussing renders any previously stored data on magnetic media

unreadable by keyboard or laboratory attack.
