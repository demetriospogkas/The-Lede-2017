- The PDF lists all the arrests made in the City of Chicago and the related offense. The tables contain information like the location of each arrest, the age and race of the offender.
- The PDF was coming in a nice tabular structure, so we parsed it through Tabula software to extract all the rows in a CSV file. The headers of each page (they were generated in the CSV ouput) were cleaned inside pandas.
